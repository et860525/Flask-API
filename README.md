# Flask-API

I make a simple API use `flask-RESTful`.
First I use flask MethodView to build but that is not convenient.

I also make a test file to test my Api.

## How to use?

Run `app.py` first than you can use `test.py` to test or use your tools(i.e. postman).

## Environment

```text
requests
Flask
Flask-RESTful
Flask-SQLAlchemy
```
